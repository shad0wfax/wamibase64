This is a modified WAMI recorder - Returns BASE64 Audio data instead of posting it to a server.
-------------------------------
The original WAMI recorder is a flash based recorder found at:
https://code.google.com/p/wami-recorder/

Akshay modified it to encode the Audio data as base64 instead of posting it to server. This allows javascript to retrieve the data and post it on its own.
All copyright notices are used as is. This is just a quick hack to enable our project.
